# Test Bench for Signal Validation: Simulated 3‑Phase System

A Python-based test framework for simulating and validating three-phase AC signals under various conditions (frequency variations, phase shifts, fault scenarios). Ideal for power system developers, protection engineers, and HIL (Hardware-in-the-Loop) simulation workflows.

## Features

- Generates balanced three-phase waveforms with adjustable frequency and phase shift
- Introduces user-defined faults (e.g., unbalances, phase drops)
- Automates signal validation routines for relay and protection algorithm testing
- Structured for easy expansion into real‑time or HIL environments

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Core Modules:** NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib (for signal generation, analysis, visualization)  
- **Testing/Validation:** PyTest or custom test scripts  
- **Documentation & Execution:** Jupyter Notebooks supported

## What It Solves

Three-phase signal validity is crucial for power system reliability. This test bench lets you:
- Simulate balanced or unbalanced 3-phase waveforms
- Vary frequency and phase for transient/fault analysis
- Automatically test and log validation results

It serves as a modular starting point for developing relay/protection logic or integrating it into a real-time HIL system.

## Background

Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation is a technique that integrates real hardware into simulated environments, making it ideal for testing control or protection systems in a realistic setting.

This framework is designed as a stepping stone toward HIL workflows, enabling offline validation before hardware integration.
